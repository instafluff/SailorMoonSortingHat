                As Sailor Mercury, The Examiner you wield the skills of being quiet, serious and dependable. 
                You thrive when it comes to practicality and lean heavily into the usage of logic when attempting
                to make a decision and choose a path to move forward down.    
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                You pair analysis with practical courses of action which usually means sticking to the rules and implementing 
                being realistic and responsibility into your everyday life.
                
                In areas such as making decisions and getting things done you shine, putting aside personal cost and replacing
                it with hard word, something that often has the ability to baffle others as a response.
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Being The Examiner you are, you often prefer to work alone, and if you’re not alone, like
                to have the ability to clearly call the shots, eliminating the worry of being let down by others
                reliability. This dedication often leads to an end result filled with nothing but high quality and large accomplishments
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                These aren’t the only areas you thrive in, with a mind built for quick sharp thoughts, and an abundance of facts you value honesty
                above most things and because of this, also take a blunt approach to responses.
