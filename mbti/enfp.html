            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Moon, The Champion you are empathetic, enthusiastic and highly energetic. You are often viewed as an inspirational leader 
                even if at times you may not personally see yourself that way. You spirit is free and wild and you enjoy spending your time investing
                in social and emotional connections with others. Although sociable, you are far more than that, ready to look at things from angles of
                curiosity and having a keen ability which lets you read between the lines. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                To The Champion, life is a very large puzzle where each little piece is connected to the next. You see through a kaleidoscopic
                prism where the lights reflect off emotions, compassion and mysticism, leading you to always seek out that deeper existing meaning.
                Because of this imaginative view of things, The Champion often also inspires others, sparking life into their imagination too. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Your imagination goes hand in hand with your need to be original, requiring room and freedom to be innovative and brainstorm up your own
                solutions to challenges, problems and tasks. This can sometimes result in The Champion feeling impatient or trapped if a boring role is
                forced upon them. A great rebuttal to this frustration comes through your power to relax, take a step back and transform into an enthusiastic free spirit often, very suddenly.
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                The Champion is happiest when it has the ability to explore all possible things, whether that be social relationships, feelings or
                even ideas. This is when their thoughts flow, their empathy comes to great usage and their courage lights up the path for them to 
                walk on, of course bringing others along the way for the journey as well.
