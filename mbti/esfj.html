            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Jupiter, The Provider you are warmhearted, practical and the sociable type. When it comes to responsibilities in your life, you take 
                them very seriously. You are the cheerleader, enjoy setting the tone of your environment and also are sensitive which pairs well with your other
                traits of being loyal, reliable and true. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                You are not devoted because you have to be, but instead truly enjoy hearing about what’s going on with friends and people you care
                about, being deeply invested in small details and a plentiful amount of warmth and sensitivity when it may be required. You are also
                talented in the art of noticing tension, doing your best to restore harmony when it may not be present.  
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Being The Provider means a lot of your energy gets channeled into things like establishing order, you thrive in areas of organization, 
                open activities and surprise get togethers where your social heart is free to interact with everyone. 
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                One of the main traits of The Provider is their sensitivity, both being an asset and a challenge when certain things hit their heart
                in a heavy way. The great thing is, that while others may disagree sometimes, that doesn’t mean that you can’t continue to do your
                best. This is in the form of being a role model, taking care of what is important to you and enjoying life because there are large amounts
                of people who appreciate The Provider not only for what they do, but who they are and the efforts they make.
