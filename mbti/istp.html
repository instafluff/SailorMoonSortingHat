                As Sailor Uranus, The Mechanic you are a known maker, exploring the world through 
                touching and examining everything around you. You enjoy diving into things head first
                which allows you to pull things apart and put them together, all while learning from your
                surroundings and the situations as you go.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Built on a steady tower made up of rationality and curiosity, you can often be hard to predict because of 
                your enigmatic ways, being able to flutter back and forth between a state of friendly to private and from calm to spontaneous. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Your world is painted with colors of practical realism, intertwined with values of fairness and willingness
                to bend the rules if the greater good is involved and maybe even step over a line if it is needed. 
                This makes The Mechanic puzzling in some situations, sometimes assuming that others are the same in this respect.
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                Your strengths align with being optimistic and energetic, creative, knowing how to prioritize, relaxed and great in a crisis. 
                All great assets that can come in handy when pursuing any new idea or tackling an intense situation.     
            </p>
