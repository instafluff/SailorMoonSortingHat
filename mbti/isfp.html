                As Sailor Neptune, The Artist you are a quiet, sensitive and kind soul who tends to lean towards being naturally artistic. 
                You have an air about you which usually creates mystery and unpredictability, pushing traditional expectations out the window
                and instead enjoying a life filled with experiments, whether that be through beauty or even behavior. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Your world is one painted with color and inspiration, allowing you to bounce to new perspectives and reinvent yourself
                or your thoughts with an ease that comes naturally to the ISFP type. Although, harboring an adventurous soul you are still
                very much introverted and because of this often enjoy quiet moments where it is just you and your mind. This makes room for
                recharging and ponderings about who you are and assessing principles and when you step back into the light leaves more room for connecting with people, 
                pursuing passions and being sensitive to those who surround you. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                When it comes to challenges, the artist type is not one to plan for the future in the form of things like assets or even retirement.
                Instead you enjoy focusing on building your identity, and collecting an array of experiences but, when combined with selflessness instead
                of selfishness, this can make for a great compliment to an already thriving personality.
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                At the end of the day The Artist is accepting, tolerant and non judgemental, holding traits like loyalty and modesty very close to their hearts.
                They enjoy taking on supporting roles and satisfying their personal sense through being kind and helpful to others.
