            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Venus, The Performer you are outgoing, friendly and accepting. It is also accurate to state that you
                love being in the spotlight, thriving when you are able to be the center of attention. You are an easily pleased
                soul, happiest when surrounded by friends where you are all just having some good fun.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Not just socially inclined, The Performer also takes pride in aesthetics through curiosity and exploration, whether that be in the form of a very
                well decorated home or extremely fashionable outfits. You have an incredible eye for all things beautiful and attractive and are not afraid to
                switch your surroundings in order to reflect your refined personal style. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Although thriving in this constant shine of limelight, The Performer is kind and sensitive to others, observing people and
                taking into account others emotions. You are the first to jump up willing to aid someone who may be struggling with something
                that is challenging, offering up a sweet platter of both support emotionally and great advice. In this area, though, you often do the
                opposite when it comes to yourself, keeping away from conflict based situations that may be critical or personally uncomfortable.
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                The Performer loves to exist within immediate moments, causing you to overlook duties or responsibilities that this type of 
                adventure requires to maintain. You like to wing it, moving away from repetitive tasks and deep analysis and aligning more with
                a reliance on luck or the possibility of opportunity to present itself. 

                You appreciate things like value and quality, always ready to offer a laugh or your exceedingly playful nature as they carry you off on another fantastical journey.
