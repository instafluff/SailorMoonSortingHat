                As Sailor Star Healer, The Strategist you are intelligent, skeptical and independent. You hold both yourself and others to a very high standard 
                and even though you radiate with self confidence you are still an introverted type who prefers to shy away from being in the spotlight. Landing 
                on various ends of the spectrum, you can be imaginative and decisive, ambitious yet private and curious with a wandering mind but yet, still focused.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                The Strategist is one to seek knowledge, you are often acknowledged as being a bookworm and are proud of how much you know, because along 
                with learning about things, this type also enjoys sharing the knowledge they gain with others -- proud of the mastery they achieve in the 
                subjects they chose to study.  
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Their fluidity is clear through their actions, gaining perspective which can easily look from both sides of a situation for example 
                being a positive dreamer but also a bitter pessimist at the same time. Although this is so, The Strategist does focus on positive notes, 
                living by the idea that nothing is impossible with the right amount of effort, thought or careful crafted intellect invested into it. This 
                allows you to step away from the feeling that others are usually too lazy or selfish to reach their own goals, and instead push forward to pursue your own. 
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                As The Strategist, some may mistake you as cold but, the matter of the fact is that you simply believe that the best way to act, is as if life were a 
                giant chess board that you can advance through by using intelligence, tactics, strategies and well put together plans. You are smart and independent 
                and at the end of the day because of this, can achieve any goal you put your mind to.
