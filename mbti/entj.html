                As Sailor Mars, The Commander you are frank, decisive, confident and charismatic. You take on the position of leader automatically and do not like laziness.
                This fiery nature is shown through your opinions, ideas and quick-mindedness which allows you to express how you feel readily. It is also easy for you to rally
                others behind you in the form of drawing a crowd as you lead everyone towards a common goal with your drive and pure determination. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                The Commander is one to truly thrive in the midst of a challenge whether that be big, small or in the middle somewhere. You believe that when
                provided with proper resources like enough time, any goal can be achieved. This also makes well for an entrepreneur based lifestyle, playing
                into your ability to form great strategies and hold focus for long periods of time when various steps for a plan need to be carried out.
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                This astounding determination also means that this type will push forward with strong willpower even when others may subside and give up. 
                This is where the E in this type comes in handy as they will be quick to stop, pick others up and push them right along to achieve the goal together. 
                Although a challenge, you enjoy any type of challenge and refuse to fold until you achieve that ultimate victory that sits at the end of that path.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                Ultimate respect for you comes from those who can challenge you intellectually and execute things with precision. For those who may not be there yet, 
                The Commander has a great ability to recognize talent in others and push them through team-building when they may not be able to see it themselves. 
                The important thing for The Commander to remember is that displaying emotions isnâ€™t weakness and that in most situations, a helpful team of people to support 
                them and even provide feedback can propel this type to the next level.
