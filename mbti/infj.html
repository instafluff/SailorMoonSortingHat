            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Saturn, The Counselor you are an idealistic, reserved and private soul. You highly value close relationships,
                and these are the only people you are willing to show your “true self” too. The Counselor tends to align their life's
                mission onto the path of helping others, engaging in positive experiences such as rescue or charity work and working hard
                to realize your goals and make a positive impact on the world.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Soft-spoken but strongly opinionated you push hard and passionately towards your ideas and beliefs, intertwining a fitting
                balance of creativity, imagination, conviction and sensitivity to create balance in your world. Because of your gentle heart,
                you also believe that nothing could benefit others more than love and compassion.  
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Although introverted you thrive when it comes to making connections with others, talented in using warm and sensitive
                language that helps people feel understood and straying away from any approach that involves pure logic and facts. Because
                of this your friends often view you as a quiet extrovert type but this doesn’t mean that you don’t also need to step away 
                and have that alone time which allows you to decompress and recharge.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                Setting everything else aside, it is also important to remember as The Counselor to take care of yourself. Often passion can result
                in carrying yourself across that breaking point line, leading you to feel exhausted, unhealthy and above all stressed. So while you
                take care of filling the world with positivity, don’t forget you need to take care of yourself too.
