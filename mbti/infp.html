                As Tuxedo Mask, The Healer you are calm, reserved and idealistic. You are insanely affectionate to those select few and work to 
                help others reach their full potential. Being a personal minded type of person, you have the risk of feeling misunderstood by 
                others, but when connecting with like-minded people this goes out the window, turning you into a gleaming soul that bubbles with
                both joy and inspiration. 

            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                As The Healer, you are guided forth by your principles, leaving behind the likes of logic and practicality when it comes to deciding
                things and moving forward. You instead look towards the likes of morality, virtue, beauty and honor, weaving pure intent into your
                choices instead of rewards or punishments.  
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                You mind is one that is fascinated by fantasy and creative ideas, making it no surprise that The Healer is often one to dabble in the arts,
                using their strong communication and imaginative mind to breathe life into worlds, scenes and words. This gift of communication also comes
                into play in your daily life, but that doesn’t mean you prefer to exist in social situations, as an introverted type, you like to share your
                focus with few people, this helps avoid energy drain and feeling overwhelmed. 
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                It is important to remember on your quest to breathe good into the world that you must also remember to stay grounded. The Healer
                is at risk of drifting off into a forgotten realm if they neglect regular life demands and single mindedly pursue their quest. This is when
                “hermit mode” kicks in cause you to need to withdraw and recharge in the quiet solace of being alone. Luckily The Healer can be caught quickly when
                reminded by close friends, partners or family that they aren’t alone with a little tug pulling them back into the real world.
