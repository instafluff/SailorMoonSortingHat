            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Artemis, The Visionary you are quick, alert and outspoken. You have a great sense of human and are often regarded as being extremely charming and
                well-liked by others. You are great at brainstorming and outlining things, which usually leads you into situations filled with mental sparring and thrilling 
                debates, which of course is where you like to have fun. With your witty remarks and great accumulation of knowledge you enjoy seeing others points of view and 
                because of that, like to build on your understanding of others reasoning. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                The Visionary means you like to take part in the big picture, putting regular tasks like managing your day-to-day or what you would call “grunt work”
                to the side in pursuit of the thrill of brainstorming, reworking and dreaming up original ideas which you are also sure to then implement by bringing
                others on to carrying this visions out.
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Being intellectually independent work best for you when you’re in charge and have the room you need to execute your visions. As The Visionary though,
                you can tend to get frustrated when placed in a position other than this, leaving you to work your way up through vision, confidence, knowledge and that witty sense of humor.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                For this type to truly succeed, an important thing to remember is that ideas require others to help assemble the pieces. By stepping back from the 
                debate and looking at things from a sentimental perspective you can truly use consideration and compromise to build up success and more than anything
                great progress towards what it is that you desire most.
