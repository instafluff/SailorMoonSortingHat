            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Star Maker, The Architect you are intelligent, insightful, analytical and logical. You are more interested in the pursuits of intellect 
                than you are social interactions, also meaning you rather enjoy discussions of knowledge and ideas. You are proud of your creativity and inventiveness 
                which also pushes this type into areas of logicians, architects or even philosophers. You breathe logic, enjoying patterns and even more so, lies. 
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                The Architect has the power to spot problems, breaking down scenarios and situations until what sits before you is a developed, unique and reliable 
                solution to any hurdle that pops up in front of them. This leads you to often stray from tasks that seem mundane, such as day-to-day activities, maintenance 
                or even practicality. When you are instead thrown into an area where your genius can bubble and brew, the results are magical.  
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                You can also often be found drifting through space, buzzing from one idea to the next, from one daydream cloud to another. This can lead you to seem detached when in 
                actuality you are simply usually engaging in a debate inside your own mind, and are actually quite friendly and relaxed, especially when with people they hold dear. 
                This outgoing mindset can be replaced though when The Architect is placed in a sea of unfamiliar faces that may result in this type to feel criticized or combative.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                An Architect must remember that their fear of failure isn’t failure itself, just because you may worry you have somehow skipped the most important piece of the puzzle, 
                doesn’t mean that you actually did. Overcoming self-doubt is where the true power lies, once that is done all the intellectual gifts and strengths this type is gifted 
                with is truly a gift itself when shined out onto the rest of the world.
