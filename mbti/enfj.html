                As Sailor Chibi Moon, The Giver you are warm, empathetic and charismatic. You have an authentic nature which draws others in, 
                going hand in hand with the fact that you truly care for others and what you stand for. Much like your fellow extroverted types 
                you are filled with passion and charisma, beaming with confidence fit for influencing a crowd, whether that be close friends or 
                through leading a community.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Having no fear, this type is unafraid to speak up when they believe something needs to be said, taking an approach of ease when 
                communicating with others. The Intuitive part of your personality also allows The Giver a flexibility when getting in touch with others, 
                using facts, logic or even emotion to relate to others and see things in a way that truly sets you apart. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                You are also talented in the realm of reflecting on or analyzing yourself, diving into your own feelings with tremendous capacity. 
                This is where The Giver should be careful when helping others, as this personality runs the risk or seeing people’s problems in themselves, 
                even if the problem isn’t there. A great remedy for this comes through this personalities ability to pull back and distinguish what they are 
                actually feeling and how that is seperate from the other person's issue. 
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                The Giver is a truly intriguing type, standing up like a champion both for those in need and against foes. They will take the hits 
                for others if it means fighting for the greater good and protecting that which they care about. Truly explaining why such a type is 
                usually found fighting for a brighter future, with a crowd of passionate follows walking very closely behind them.
