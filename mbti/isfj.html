            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Sailor Pluto, The Protector you have a loyal heart to go along with your quiet, yet responsible and thoughtful personality.
                Above all you respect duty and because of this will push beyond the boundaries of what is expected of you, especially when it
                concerns others and their well being. Although leaning in the realm of introverts, the break this mould when it comes to their well-developed social skills and strong relationships.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                The Protector will also often find themselves wrapped up in perfectionism and their skills shine through when no
                matter the amount of procrastination they engage in still wonâ€™t prevent them from getting a task done on time or with being reliable. 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Working to exceed expectations usually results in great results, something you as The Protector may underplay, something which also spreads
                into accomplishments and grand achievements. But watch out for those who see this as an opportunity, as a personality who is more selfish 
                will likely take advantage of this kindness and humbleness.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                Your ability to connect with others is one of the qualities that sets you apart from the other personalities. You are naturally
                sensitive and enjoy making connections with others, blooming through your imagination an unwavering support which you give to
                people, especially those who you deem as being extremely close to.
