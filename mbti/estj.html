            <p class="first-paragraph">
                As Luna, The Supervisor your disposition consists of practicality, realism and a matter-of-fact way of life. 
                Above all you are strong willed with opinions that you have no problem expressing to others. These of course,
                all work as positives as you are built on a foundation of honesty, dedication and dignity. Along with giving
                great advice and guidance to others, you also work hard to bring people together, being a great organizer whether
                it is in your life or even a community.
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                You are able to look at the world clearly, and never waver on what you believe in, nor on your principles or the
                view of the world you have. Falling into this Supervisor category also means that you tend to lean towards a 
                leading position, always willing to take on challenging tasks in a way that makes everything look easy to others.
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                Although generous, others shouldn’t take advantage of your grand personality, faltering through broken 
                promises or dishonesty will cause you to cast your wrath onto those who have caused you this grief. 
                But, this isn’t because you are stubborn, it simply means you value you what you believe in, and also think others should as well.  
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                As a Supervisor you adhere to your values, proving time and time again to be trustworthy and a great source of reliability to those who may need it.     
            </p>
