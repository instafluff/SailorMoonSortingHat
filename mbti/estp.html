                As Sailor Star Fighter, The Promoter you are social, spontaneous and extremely passionate.
                It is also accurate to say that you are popular and charming bringing along with you to situations
                your live in the moment attitude.  
                
                You enjoy being the center of everyone’s attention, you’re entertaining and blunt with a sense 
                of humor that has the power to bring a smile to anyone's face and can often be found volunteering yourself 
                for situations which require one.    
            </p>

            <p class="second-paragraph">
                Being The Promoter means leaping into the unknown before checking what might be before you and although you
                do enjoy an energetic conversation, you’d much rather jump on things and just go to them instead. These traits 
                aid your ability to solve issues or mistakes as you go, because at the end of the day, you’re much better moving 
                forward then you are sitting idle on the sidelines. 
 
            </p>

            <p class="third-paragraph">
                You are perceptive and have an unfiltered view of things, allowing you to spot small details that other personalities may 
                overlook. What’s more, is how you use these observations to question things or apply them to something else you may deem helpful.
            </p>

            <p class="fourth-paragraph">
                Sailor Star Fighter marks the qualities and blend of both energy and rationality which winds itself through your colorful personality.
                You bring excitement wherever you travel, pulling those who may be cautious along with you, into a world full of rewarding experiences
                and great opportunity.
